# Enable RTL

Switch component has RTL support. This can be achieved by setting [`enableRtl`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-blazor/Syncfusion.EJ2.RazorComponents~Syncfusion.EJ2.RazorComponents.Buttons.EjsSwitch~EnableRtl.html) as `true`.

The following example illustrates how to enable right-to-left support in Switch component.

`Index.razor`

```csharp

<EjsSwitch ID="default" EnableRtl="true"></EjsSwitch>

  ```
